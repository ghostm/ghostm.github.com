In my last [post](http://ghostm.github.com/2011/02/24/Optimized-for-Happiness.html) I said that I had one goal for the year.

Achievement Unlocked: Work for a company that is optimized for happiness

In May I started working for [DragonForged Software](http://dragonforged.com) and it has completely changed the way I think about how work and life interact.  Technically speaking DFSW is setup as a [Results-Only Work Environment](http://www.gorowe.com/), but in simpler terms means that my job revolves around my life.

I'm able to work with many incredibly smart people on challenging projects, but I'm also able to spend more time with my family and friends (and anything else that is important to me).  And after spending all this extra time on my priorities I'm more productive at work than I've ever been.  It's really awesome.
