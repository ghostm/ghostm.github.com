I have one goal for the this year:

Work for a company that is optimized for happiness.

Check out this [post](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/10/18/optimize-for-happiness.html) by Tom Preston-Werner to get a better idea of the type of place I want to work.

If I can't find a place that has this quality and needs someone with my skills I suppose I'll have to start my own.
