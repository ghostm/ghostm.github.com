		<p>Hi, I'm Matthew, a.k.a. GhostM</p>

		<p>I spend most of my life typing at a computer trying to tell a story.</p>
		<p>In the day I'm probably doing work for the totally awesome <a href="http://www.dragonforged.com/">DragonForged Software</a></p>
		<p>At night I try and work on one of the many projects I have going on.  Lately I've been using <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, <a href="http://www.liftweb.net/">Lift</a>, and <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> for the cloud portion of an iOS app that I hope will be ready for the public soon.</p>
		<p>I've been a math and science nerd for as long as I can remember, and in the last few years I've become a literature nerd.  Halfway through college I added English as a second major, and I've been a writer since.  When I feel up to taking on something challenging I work on one of my pieces of fiction (I really need to work on the second draft of my novel).</p>

		<p>I live in Boulder, CO with my beautiful wife, C.</p>
